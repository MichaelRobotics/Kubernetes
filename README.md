## ðŸ”„ GitHub Workflows

The repository contains several GitHub workflows for CI/CD automation. Here's an overview of the key workflows:

### Core Workflows

1. **custom-ci-cd.yml** - PRIMARY WORKFLOW
   - Purpose: Main CI/CD pipeline for building and deploying the opentelemetry-demo
   - Triggers: Push to main branch affecting opentelemetry-demo directory
   
2. **component-build-images.yml**
   - Purpose: Builds container images for individual components
   - Used by: custom-ci-cd and other workflows

3. **build-images.yml**
   - Purpose: Tests image generation for changes to src/test files
   - Triggers: Push events affecting source or test files

4. **checks.yml**
   - Purpose: Runs linting and other code quality checks
   - Triggers: Push and pull requests to main branch

### Additional Workflows (Consider Removing)

1. **stale.yml**
   - Purpose: Automatically closes stale PRs
   - Recommended: Only keep if you have many contributors and PRs

2. **nightly-release.yml**
   - Purpose: Creates nightly builds of all components
   - Recommended: Only keep if you need nightly builds for testing

3. **release.yml**
   - Purpose: Publishes container images for GitHub releases
   - Recommended: Only keep if you're publishing official releases

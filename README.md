## ðŸ”„ GitHub Workflows

The repository contains several optimized GitHub workflows for CI/CD automation. Each workflow has been configured to trigger at the appropriate time without overlapping:

### Core Workflows

1. **custom-ci-cd.yml** - PRIMARY WORKFLOW
   - Purpose: Main CI/CD pipeline for building and deploying the opentelemetry-demo
   - Triggers: Only on push to main branch or manual workflow dispatch
   - Functions: Builds and pushes Docker images, performs protobuf checks, deploys the demo
   
2. **component-build-images.yml**
   - Purpose: Reusable workflow that handles container image building
   - Usage: Not triggered directly - called by other workflows
   - Functions: Provides Docker build functionality for other workflows
   
3. **build-images.yml**
   - Purpose: Quick verification of container images
   - Triggers: Pull requests affecting src/**, test/**, or Dockerfile files
   - Functions: Validates builds without pushing images
   
4. **checks.yml**
   - Purpose: Code quality checks
   - Triggers: Pull requests and pushes to non-main branches
   - Excludes: Markdown files and documentation changes
   - Functions: Runs markdownlint and validates images without pushing

### Supporting Workflows

5. **run-integration-tests.yml**
   - Purpose: Runs integration tests
   - Triggers: On pull request reviews and pull requests
   - Functions: Executes end-to-end tests with tracetesting
   
6. **dependabot-auto-update-protobuf-diff.yml**
   - Purpose: Maintains protobuf files when dependencies change
   - Triggers: PRs affecting dependency files (package.json, go.mod, etc.)
   - Functions: Runs only for dependabot PRs to auto-update protobuf files
   
7. **gradle-wrapper-validation.yml**
   - Purpose: Security check for Gradle wrappers
   - Triggers: Only when Gradle wrapper files change
   - Functions: Validates wrapper checksums for security

8. **label-pr.yml**
   - Purpose: Automatically labels pull requests
   - Triggers: When PRs are opened, synchronized, or reopened
   - Functions: Adds labels based on changed files for easier PR management

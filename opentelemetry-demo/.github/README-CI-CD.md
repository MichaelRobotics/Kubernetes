# CI/CD Setup for OpenTelemetry Demo

This guide explains how to set up the CI/CD pipeline for building and pushing Docker images to your private Docker Hub repository.

## Repository Structure Note

This project is organized in a subdirectory structure:
- The OpenTelemetry Demo code is in the `opentelemetry-demo/` subdirectory
- The workflow watches for changes to files in both the root directory and the `opentelemetry-demo/` subdirectory

Make sure to modify files in the correct location to trigger the workflow.

## Required GitHub Secrets

Before you can use the workflow, you need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
2. `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password or access token (recommended)

## Setting Up GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click on "New repository secret"
5. Add each of the required secrets:
   - Name: `DOCKER_USERNAME`
   - Value: Your Docker Hub username
   - Click "Add secret"
   - Name: `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
   - Value: Your Docker Hub password or access token
   - Click "Add secret"

## About the CI/CD Workflow

The workflow (`custom-ci-cd.yml`) does the following:

1. Triggers on:
   - Push to the `main` branch (when changes are made to `src/`, `test/`, or `.env.override`)
   - Pull requests to the `main` branch
   - Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch) with a version parameter

2. Jobs:
   - `protobufcheck`: Ensures Protocol Buffers are correctly generated
   - `build_and_push_images`: Builds and pushes Docker images for all microservices to `robclusterdev/clusterimages`
   - `deploy_demo`: Updates the `.env.override` file for deployment

3. The images are tagged as:
   - `robclusterdev/clusterimages:<service-name>`
   - `robclusterdev/clusterimages:<version>-<service-name>` (version is either "latest" or specified during manual trigger)

## Running the Workflow Manually

To run the workflow manually with a custom version:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Click on "Custom CI/CD Pipeline" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter a version tag (e.g., "v1.0.0")
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Local Testing

To test locally:

1. Ensure Docker is installed and you're logged in to Docker Hub
2. Pull your repository
3. Run `make start` to start the application with your custom images
